        <h1 id="appeal">Let's help flood affected people in Bangladesh</h1>
        <p id="appeal">Heavy monsoon rains over the past few days have led to rivers bursting their banks, cutting off
            around 2
            million people in northeast Bangladesh. Many families are stranded and could run out of food within
            days.Homes and schools as
            well as vital infrastructure such as power supply lines, water sources and roads are all damaged or
            underwater. Many people have been affected by floods for the second time in a month, after severe flooding
            also struck the region in mid-May.

            <p>When floods strike, vulnerable children, women, men, and elders are cut off from life-saving medicine,
                vital
                communication, and transport. Thousands of toilets and tube wells have already been destroyed, and
                without
                adequate sanitation and shelter, many are even more vulnerable to the spread of disease. The people of
                the
